					<h2 class="post-title">Welcome to the Independent in Iowa Blog</h2>
					<p class="post-meta text-uppercase">4/25/15 - by John Hale</p>
				</header>
				
				<section class="post-body">

					<p><strong>There are over 700,000 of us in Iowa; and we’re invisible.</strong></p>
		
					<p>We are No Party voters. "No Party" is the Iowa way of describing Independent voters like me who prefer, for any number of reasons, to not be formally affiliated with either the Republican or Democratic parties.</p>
		
					<p>And this may surprise you – the No Party/Independent voting block is the largest in Iowa. According to the Iowa Secretary of State’s Office, the breakdown of active Iowa registered voters, as of April, 2015, is:</p>
		
					<p class="text-center">
						<ul class="list-inline">
							<li><strong>Democrat:</strong> 590,046</li>
							<li><strong>Republican:</strong> 612,197</li>
							<li><strong>No Party (Independent)</strong>: 708,665</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
		
					<p>Since I’m neither a political or social scientist, I can’t provide “expert” insight on who we are or why. Based on the Independent thinkers and voters I know in Iowa and beyond, most of us:</p>
		
					<ul>
						<li>Are tired of politics as usual – the bickering, the pettiness, the childishness.</li>
						<li>Are fed up with elected leaders who care more about themselves, their party, and their re-election than they do about doing the right thing for the public they serve.</li>
						<li>Are sickened by the ugliness of campaigns and the obscene amounts of money spent to get or hold-on to elected office.</li>
						<li>Are pragmatic – wanting elected leaders to do what everyone in real life has to do – work together to get stuff done.</li>
					</ul>
		
					<h3>It’s My Party and I’ll Vote How I Want To (with apologies to Leslie Gore)</h3>
		
					<p class="lead">We No Party/Independent folks are a big reason why Iowa is referred to as a toss-up state, a swing state, or a battleground state. We’re not blue, we’re not red. We’re a nice shade of purple.</p>
		
					<p class="lead">Independents drive election results. Yet we’re often nowhere to be found in the public dialogue or the political agenda. If we’re thought of, it’s as an after-thought.</p>
		
					<p>We hear the view from the left. We hear the view from the right. We’re bombarded by both elected and unelected talking heads on cable and talk radio, in print and in social media. Sometimes those voices seem reasonable; all too often the voices inflame rather than inform, and preach to their choirs and gin-up the faithful rather than perform any kind of public service.</p>
		
					<p><strong>It seems to me that it’s time to hear the view from the middle. The view of middle-America. The view from the middle of the political spectrum;</strong> from people who are willing to look at issues from multiple angles, who know that "changing your mind" on an issue is more often a sign of strength than a sign of weakness, who think that using common sense is still a pretty good approach to decision making, and who truly believe that great candidates are like great ideas – they can come from anywhere.</p>
		
					<p>I don’t pretend to be <u>THE</u> voice of the middle, but I am A voice. One that will hopefully encourage other voices, and share them with you and those who join us on this journey.</p>
		
					<p>My hope is that this blog will allow No Party/Independent thinkers and voters to become more visible, and to turn that visibility into expanded influence. </p>
		
					<h3>And so... WHAT is this blog?</h3>
		
					<p>My plan is for this blog to be informative; even provocative at times. I want it to make you think. I hope it encourages you to become more engaged in the political process, and to have greater impact on what gets done in the public arena and how. And I want this blog to be interesting and yes, even fun.</p>
		
					<p>I want this to be something that Iowans – and folks from outside of this great state – look forward to getting in their e-mail  (once a week) or will seek out on the web. I want it to be something where we form a cyber-relationship with one another. And I want it to be something you will enjoy enough that you’ll share it with others.</p>
		
					<p>One thing I’m sure of. This blog will evolve. There is no blueprint to follow; that’s part of the adventure.</p>
		
					<h3>And finally, WHO is this blog for? </h3>
		
					<p>It’s for <u>all kinds of people</u> across the political spectrum who thirst for something different and find the No Party/Independent mindset to be of interest. It’s for <u>journalists and thought leaders</u> who are looking for fresh ideas and perspectives. And it’s for <u>elected leaders and candidates</u> who want to know what we’re thinking and talking about – and who and what we might support.</p> 
		
					<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts. Put your tray-tables in their upright position, and get ready for the official launch next week.</p>
		
					<p>Thanks for reading! And since our goal is to build a community of readers as quickly as possible – thanks for sharing this with co-workers and colleagues, friends and family!</p>

					<h4>Today's Challenge:</h4>
		
					<p>Think of a song that every candid candidate – especially those Presidential candidates – should have blaring out of the speakers as they walk into a crowded room. Ponder it and let me know your song pick down in the comments. The best responses get a shout-out in next week’s edition. Here’s my nomination:</p>

				<p>John is a native Iowan. A small-town boy raised in Collins in Story County, he’s lived or worked in Ottumwa, Oskaloosa, Des Moines, Grimes, Spencer, Fort Dodge and Ankeny. He’s a recovering Democrat who became a registered No Party/Independent voter due to frustration with both political parties and their inability or unwillingness to work together for the common good.</p>
